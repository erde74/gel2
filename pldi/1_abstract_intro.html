<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>



We propose an automatic memory management
mechanism based on ownership types and run-time reference
counts.&nbsp; The type system distinguishes owning
and non-owning pointers, and ensures that&nbsp;there is always
exactly one owning pointer to every object. &nbsp;When an owning
pointer is destroyed, the object it
points to is destroyed as well.&nbsp; At run time, the language
implementation keeps a reference
count of the number of non-owning pointers to each object. &nbsp;If
a destroyed object has a
non-zero reference count, a run-time error occurs and the program is
terminated; it is the programmer's responsibility to avoid this
condition.<br>



<br>



This mechanism can be used to implement a safe programming
language which frees objects deterministically and efficiently.
&nbsp;To show this, we've designed and implemented a
simple&nbsp;language, Gel,&nbsp;which is essentially a subset
of C#
extended with ownership-based memory management. &nbsp;We present
Gel's
type system and type conversion rules in detail. &nbsp;The Gel
compiler and
interpreter is implemented in Gel itself; we describe our experiences
using the Gel type system for writing a program of this size.
&nbsp;We
explain how the Gel compiler&nbsp;uses ownership information to
eliminate most reference counts at compile time, allowing many Gel
programs to execute nearly as quickly as their manually managed
counterparts. &nbsp;We present a number of benchmark results
comparing
the CPU usage and memory consumption of programs written in Gel, C++,
Java and C#.

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>



Today, most system programming is done in languages which are <dfn>unsafe</dfn>:
program errors may lead to arbitrary or undefined behavior.&nbsp; C
and C++ are unsafe languages commonly used for system
programming.&nbsp; Unsafe languages have certain fundamental
disadvantages over <dfn>safe</dfn> languages [Pierce,
2002] such as Java, C# and ML.&nbsp; Certain classes of bugs such
as buffer overruns or reads from deallocated memory can occur only in
unsafe languages.&nbsp; Many such bugs are subtle or
non-deterministic, and hence expensive in software
engineering.&nbsp; In addition, trusted and untrusted code may
safely share a single address space only in a safe language.
<p>There would thus be many advantages to using safe languages
for system programming.&nbsp; But there are challenges involved in
making safe languages as efficient as unsafe languages in their
run-time resource usage.&nbsp; In particular, any safe language
must have some sort of automatic memory management mechanism: explicit
memory allocation and deallocation as found in C and C++ is inherently
unsafe, as there is nothing to prevent a program from writing to
deallocated memory.&nbsp; The most widely used automatic memory
management mechanisms include classical reference counting and garbage
collection [Jones, 1996].&nbsp; Reference counting may incur
substantial run-time overhead and cannot easily free cyclic data
structures.&nbsp; Garbage collected-systems often use substantially
more memory than their manually managed counterparts.&nbsp; An
additional disadvantage of garbage collection is that it frees memory
non-deterministically.&nbsp; Deterministic destruction
is&nbsp;useful in system programming, especially in languages in
which allow arbitrary user code to run when objects are destroyed; such
code may be used to release system resources when no longer needed.</p>



<p>In this paper we propose an automatic memory management
mechanism based on ownership types and run-time reference
counts.&nbsp; The mechanism can be used to implement a safe
language which frees objects deterministically.&nbsp; To show that
the ownership mechanism is practical, we've constructed a simple
object-oriented language Gel which is essentially a subset of C#
extended with ownership-based memory management.&nbsp; We've
implemented an interpreter and compiler for Gel, written in the Gel
language itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; We've ported a number of common
benchmark programs to Gel and have found that the Gel implementations
often perform similarly to their C++ counterparts and use significantly
less memory than their Java and C# equivalents.<br>



</p>



<h3>OWNERSHIP-BASED MEMORY MANAGEMENT</h3>



<p>Our proposed memory management mechanism has the following
fundamental characteristics:</p>



<ul>



  <li>Objects are allocated individually using a heap
allocator.&nbsp; Deallocation is automatic; there is no <code>delete</code>
statement.</li>



  <li>The type system distinguishes <dfn>owning</dfn>
and <dfn>non-owning</dfn> pointers to objects.&nbsp;
This is a compile-time distinction only: at run time, all pointers are
represented as ordinary memory addresses.</li>



  <li>The type system ensures that at run time there is always
exactly one owning pointer to every object.</li>



  <li>Ownership of an object may <dfn>transfer </dfn>as
a program runs.&nbsp; Any owning pointer which loses ownership of
an object becomes null if it may be read again.</li>



  <li>At run time, the language implementation keeps a reference
count of the number of non-owning pointers to each object.</li>



  <li>When a non-null owning pointer is destroyed, the object it
points to is destroyed as well.&nbsp; If a destroyed object has a
non-zero reference count, a run-time error occurs and the program is
terminated; it is the programmer's responsibility to avoid this
condition.</li>



</ul>



<p>Our goal in this work is to show that a safe language with
such a
type system and memory management mechanism can be implemented, and can
be practical in the
following senses:</p>



<ul>



  <li>It is easy to write real programs so that they pass the
type checker; impementing common data structures is straightforward.</li>



  <li>It is easy to write programs so that they never yield
run-time errors due to non-zero reference counts on destroyed objects.</li>



  <li>Programs run efficiently, ideally consuming roughly as much
memory and CPU time as their manually managed counterparts.</li>



</ul>



<p>To this end, we've designed and implemented a simple
object-oriented language, Gel, which uses ownership-based memory
management.&nbsp; In the remainder of this paper we'll describe
Gel in some detail and discuss how Gel performs on some
real-world benchmarks.</p>



<p>We could conceivably construct a minimal ownership-based type
system based on a typed lambda calculus and provide formal proofs of
type safety and other properties.&nbsp; We have not done that in
this work, as our primary goal here is to demonstrate the viability of
ownership-based memory management in a real-world
implementation.&nbsp; We will not provide a&nbsp;proof of type
safety for Gel, as the language is large enough that such a proof might
be unwieldy.&nbsp; We nevertheless believe that the language as
described is type safe.</p>
