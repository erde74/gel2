<h2>THE GEL LANGUAGE</h2>

<p>Gel is a subset of the C# programming language [Hejlsberg,
2004] extended with ownership types.&nbsp; Our decision to extend
C# rather than, say, Java was arbitrary, and it would be
straightforward to construct a similar language extending Java or
another object-oriented language.&nbsp; The Gel language is large
enough to write useful programs, such as the Gel interpreter/compiler
itself.</p>

<p>Unlike languages with simple manual memory management schemes
(such as malloc/free or new/delete), Gel is <dfn>safe</dfn>:
a bug in a Gel program can never corrupt memory arbitrarily.&nbsp;
Unlike garbage-collected languages, memory management in Gel is <i>deterministic</i>:
objects are freed as soon as they are no longer needed.
&nbsp;Unlike traditional reference-counting schemes, Gel can free
data structures including <dfn>cycles</dfn> of pointers as
described below.</p>

<p>In this paper, we&nbsp;describe only Gel's ownership
extensions to the
C# language. &nbsp;A reader familiar with either C# or Java should
be able to follow with no trouble; differences between the
core&nbsp;C# and Java languages are relatively minor and are not
relevant to the discussion here. For a complete description of Gel, see
the&nbsp;language reference [Gel].
&nbsp;The Gel project site (http://code.google.com/p/gel2/source)
contains the Gel interpreter/compiler, released as open source under
the MIT License.</p>

We proceed as follows. &nbsp;We first
give an informal overview of&nbsp;ownership in Gel,
illustrated with a number of code examples. &nbsp;We then present
detailed rules for type checking and an argument that the single-owner
property holds in Gel.<br>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Gel, like C#, includes both <dfn>value types</dfn>&nbsp;and
<dfn>reference types</dfn>. &nbsp;Value types in Gel
are
primitive types including <code>bool</code>, <code>int</code>
and <code>float</code>. Reference types include <code>object</code>,
<code>string</code> and user-defined subclasses of <code>object</code>.
&nbsp;Gel extends C#'s type
system with <dfn>owning&nbsp;types</dfn>.&nbsp;
The
type T ^ (where T
is a reference type) represents an owning
pointer to
an object of type <code>T</code>.&nbsp; A reference
type written
without a <code>^</code> character indicates a non-owning
pointer. &nbsp;Like a non-owning pointer, an owning pointer may
hold either an object reference or <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>In Gel, as in C#, all value and reference types are ultimately
derived from the top-level <code>object</code>
type. &nbsp;Strictly speaking, inheritance applies only to value
and
reference types; owning types are not themselves considered members of
the class inheritance graph.</p>

<p>Local variables, method parameters, method return
values and object fields may all have owning or non-owning types.</p>

<p>In Gel there is
always exactly one owning pointer to every object. &nbsp;As a
consequence of this fact, all objects in a running Gel program belong
to a set of ownership trees; tree roots include static fields of every
class and local variables in every stack frame. &nbsp;(During the
course of
expression evaluation, temporary values of owning type may form
additional tree roots.)</p>

<p>Ownership
of an object can <dfn>transfer</dfn>
from an owning pointer
P to an owning pointer Q. &nbsp;In this case we say that P <dfn>loses
ownership</dfn>
of the object and that Q <dfn>takes ownership</dfn> of the
object.</p>

<p>At run time, the Gel implementation keeps a count of the
number of
non-owning pointers to each object; this count may be zero or an
arbitrary positive value. &nbsp;The count is used only for ensuring
that no non-owning pointers remain to a destroyed object as described
in a following section.</p>

<p>Here's a minimal Gel program:</p>

<pre>class Foo {<br> public static void Main() {<br> Foo ^f = new Foo();<br> }<br>}</pre>

<p>The <code>new</code> operator returns an owning
pointer.&nbsp; In this program, the local variable <code>f</code>
receives ownership of the newly allocated object.&nbsp; When <code>Main()</code>
exits and <code>f</code> goes out of scope, Gel destroys
the object automatically.</p>

<p>If an owning pointer variable is updated with a new value, any
previously pointed-to object is destroyed immediately:</p>

<pre>void Fun() {<br> Foo ^f = new Foo(); // allocates a new Foo<br> f = new Foo(); // the first Foo allocated is destroyed here<br> f = null; // the second Foo allocated is destroyed here<br> ...<br>}</pre>

<p>An assignment to an owning&nbsp;variable causes an
ownership transfer:</p>

<pre>void Fun() {<br> Foo ^f = new Foo();<br> Foo ^g = f; // ownership transfers to g<br>}</pre>

<p>It is a compile-time error to read from any local
variable which may have lost ownership:</p>

<pre>void Fun() {<br> Foo ^f = new Foo();<br> Foo ^g = f; // ownership transfers to g<br> Foo h = f; // error: f has lost ownership<br>}<br></pre>

The Gel type checker enforces this restriction by performing control
flow
analysis on each method and ensuring that no owning variable loses
ownership on any code path leading to a point where the variable is
read. &nbsp;This is a straightforward extension of the mechanism
used to ensure that every variable is initialized before use.<br>

<br>

Gel could, alternatively, cause an owning local variable to become null
if it loses ownership. &nbsp;We've decided against this behavior
since this side effect might not be obviously apparent to someone
reading the code. &nbsp;More fundamentally, this would destroy the
language's <dfn>erasure</dfn> property, described in a
following section.<br>

<h3>Fields</h3>

As mentioned above, object fields&nbsp;(including both instance
fields and static
fields) may have either owning or non-owning types.&nbsp; Here is a
singly linked list class
which&nbsp;holds
an integer in each node:
<pre>class Node {<br> public Node ^next_;<br> public int i_;<br> public Node(int i) { i_ = i; }<br>}<br></pre>

Gel includes an operator <code>take</code>&nbsp; which
takes ownership of
a value from an owning field, and has the side effect of
setting the field's value to <code>null</code>.
&nbsp;An expression which reads an owning field without using <code>take</code>
has a non-owning pointer type:
<pre>void main() {<br>&nbsp; Node ^n = new Node(5);<br>&nbsp; n.next_ &nbsp;= new Node(4);<br> Node ^p = n.next_; // compile-time error: no conversion from Node to Node ^<br>&nbsp; Node ^p = take n.next_; &nbsp;// okay: ownership transfers; now n.next_ is null<br>}<br></pre>

<p>Gel&nbsp;could conceivably take ownership from and null
out owning fields automatically whenever they're read in an owning
context; then the <code>take</code> operator would be
unnecessary.&nbsp; But then the side effect of nulling out a field
would be much less apparent to programmers; Gel includes <code>take</code>
so that this side effect is explicit (and to preserve the erasure
property described below).<br>

</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

A method parameter with owning type&nbsp;takes
ownership of the value passed to that parameter when the method is
invoked.&nbsp; If a method's return type is owning, then the
method's caller takes ownership of the return value when the method
returns.<br>

<br>

Here is a doubly linked list class with
an integer in each node; its constructor takes arguments with owning
and non-owning pointer types:
<pre>class Node {<br> int i_;<br> public Node ^next_;<br> public Node prev_;</pre>

<pre> public Node(int i, Node ^n, Node p) { i_ = i; next_ = n; prev_ = p; }<br>}</pre>

<p>As a larger example, the following method&nbsp;takes an
integer <code>k</code>
and returns a doubly linked list containing the integers 1 through <code>k</code>:</p>

<pre>Node ^IntList(int k) {<br> Node ^n = null;<br> for (int i = 1 ; i &lt;= k ; ++i) {<br> Node o = n; // keep a pointer to previous head of list<br> n = new Node(i, n, null);<br> if (o != null)<br> o.prev_ = n; // create backlink<br> }<br> return n;<br>}</pre>

<p>In the line which calls the <code>new Node()</code>
constructor, the owning variable <code>n</code> first
loses ownership of the object it points to, since it passes that value
to a constructor parameter with owning type: the constructor takes
ownership of the object passed.&nbsp; After the constructor
returns, <code>n</code> receives ownership of the newly
allocated object.</p>

<h3>Type Casts</h3>

<p>Type casts in Gel never affect whether a type is owning; a
cast is always from an owning type to an owning type or from an
non-owning type to an non-owning type.&nbsp; Syntactically, a cast
is always written with a non-owning type, even if the type it affects
is owning.&nbsp; Thus:</p>

<pre>void Fun() {<br> Foo ^f = new Foo();<br> Bar ^b = (Bar) f; // f loses ownership to b here<br>}</pre>

<p>Gel, like C#, includes operators <code>is</code>
and <code>as</code>&nbsp;which perform run-time type
checks. &nbsp;The expression <code>E is T</code>
evaluates E to a value v, and returns true if v is of type T and false
otherwise. &nbsp;The expression <code>E as T</code>
evaluates E to a value v, and returns v if it is of type T and null
otherwise. &nbsp;Like type casts, the <code>is</code>
and <code>as</code>
operators&nbsp;are&nbsp;always written with non-owning types,
but may operate on either owning or non-owning types:</p>

<pre>void Fun() {<br> Foo ^f = new Foo();<br> Bar ^b = f as Bar;<br>}</pre>

<h3>this</h3>

In Gel <code>this</code> is always a non-owning
pointer:
<pre>class Foo {<br> static Foo ^f;<br> ...<br> void Fun() {<br> f = this; // compile-time error: can't convert from Foo to Foo ^<br> }<br>}</pre>

<h3>Strings</h3>

<p>Strings in Gel are not owned; the type <code>string ^</code>
does not exist.&nbsp; In a compiled Gel program, strings are
internally reference counted; a string is freed when its reference
count reaches zero.</p>

<p>We thought about making strings owned in Gel, but strings are
so common in real-world programs that we thought it might burdensome
for programmers to have to worry about string ownership.&nbsp;
There's no problem with using classical reference counting for strings:
they don't point to other objects so they can never be involved in a
pointer cycle.</p>

<p>A <code>string</code> may be converted either to
an <code>object ^</code>&nbsp; or to an <code>object</code>:</p>

<pre>void Fun() {<br> object ^o = "a"; // ok<br> object p = "b"; // ok<br>}</pre>

<h3>Arrays</h3>

In Gel an array may hold either owning or non-owning pointers:
<pre>void Fun() {<br> Foo [] ^a = new Foo[5]; // an array of non-owning pointers to Foo objects<br> Foo ^[] ^b = new Foo^[5]; // an array of owning pointers to Foo objects<br> b[0] = new Foo();<br> a[0] = b[0];<br>}</pre>

<p>The <code>take</code> operator may operate on
array elements:</p>

<pre>void Fun() {<br> Foo ^[] ^a = new Foo^[5];<br> a[0] = new Foo();<br> Foo ^f = take a[0];<br>}<br></pre>

<h3>Autoboxing</h3>

Gel&nbsp;(like Java and C#) provides <dfn>autoboxing</dfn>:
a simple value such an <code>int</code> or <code>bool</code>
may be stored in a variable holding an object.&nbsp; In Gel, a
boxed value always has the owning type <code>object ^</code>.&nbsp;
For example:
<pre>void Fun() {<br> object ^o = 7; // ok<br> object p = false; // compile-time error: can't convert from bool to object<br>}</pre>

<p>In an owning type <code>T ^</code>, <code>T</code>
must not be a value type; the types <code>int ^</code>
and <code>bool ^</code> do not exist in Gel, for
example.&nbsp; An unboxing conversion must be explicit, and yields
a value type:</p>

<pre>void Fun() {<br> object ^o = 7;<br> int i = (int) o;<br>}</pre>

<h3>Object Destruction</h3>

Whenever an owning pointer to an object o is destroyed without
transferring ownership elsewhere, then Gel <dfn>destroys</dfn>
o as
follows.&nbsp; First&nbsp;Gel destroys all fields in o (in
reverse lexical
order); if any of these fields are owning pointers to other objects
then those objects are destroyed recursively.&nbsp; Finally Gel
checks
o's non-owning
reference count.&nbsp; If the reference count is non-zero, Gel
issues a run-time error and terminates the program; otherwise Gel frees
the memory used to store o and continues execution.
<p>This simple destruction algorithm can destroy linked data
structures automatically.
&nbsp;If each node of
a singly linked list contains an owning pointer to the next node in the
list, then when a pointer to the list head goes out of scope Gel will
destroy the entire list.</p>

<p>Because an object's subobjects are destroyed before the
object's
reference count is checked, the algorithm can destroy many data
structures containing pointer cycles. &nbsp;As a simple example,
the
following method uses the IntList method presented earlier to create a
doubly-linked list containing 2 nodes:</p>

<pre>void MakeList() {<br> Node ^n = IntList(2);<br>}<br></pre>

When the method exits, the variable n goes out of scope and the list is
destroyed automatically. &nbsp;Initially, the first list node has a
non-owning reference count of 1 since the second list node points to
it. &nbsp;Before checking the first node's reference count, Gel
destroys the second list node, which destroys the non-owning pointer to
the first node and hence decrements the first node's reference count to
0.<br>

<br>

In general, then, Gel&nbsp;can automatically destroy any data
structure in
which every non-owning pointer from an object o points to an object
which is an ancestor of o in the object ownership tree.<br>

<br>

Gel's object destruction algorithm has some significant limitations.
&nbsp;Most fundamentally, it cannot destroy arbitrary graphs
of non-owning pointers; if a data structure contains non-owning
pointers to non-ancestor nodes, then the programmer must write code to
null out those pointers before the structure is destroyed.
&nbsp;Another problem is that&nbsp;the algorithm may use a
large amount
of stack space when destroying objects due to its recursive nature.
&nbsp;In the Extensions section, below, we propose a better
algorithm
for destroying objects in Gel.<br>

<h3>Type Conversions</h3>

In the sections above we've&nbsp;described how ownership interacts
with various Gel language features, and presented various examples
where Gel allows or disallows conversions between owning and non-owning
types. &nbsp;In this section we give a more complete description of
Gel's&nbsp;rules for type conversions.<br>

<br>

Gel classifies each expression in a program as one of the following <dfn>kinds</dfn>:<br>

<ul>

  <li>A <dfn>variable</dfn>: either</li>

  <ul>

    <li>a local variable or method parameter variable</li>

    <li><code>(type) E</code>, where E is classified
as a variable</li>

    <li><code>E as type</code>, where E is classified
as a variable</li>

    <li><code>E ? E1 : E2</code>, where E1 and E2 are
classified as variables</li>

  </ul>

  <li>A <dfn>field</dfn>: either</li>

  <ul>

    <li>an access to a instance field or static field</li>

    <li>an access to an array element</li>

  </ul>

  <li>A <dfn>value</dfn>: any other expression</li>

</ul>

Gel, like C# and Java, includes both <dfn>implicit</dfn>
and <dfn>explicit</dfn>
type
conversions. &nbsp;A number of language contructs implicitly
convert a
value to a destination type. &nbsp;Explicit type conversions are
performed by the type cast operator and by a small number of other
language constructs.<br>

<br>

Every implicit conversion in Gel takes place in one of the following
conversion contexts:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Assignment context: in an assignment V = E, when implicitly
converting from the type of E to the type of V</li>

  <li>Argument conversion context: in a method call, when
implicitly converting a method&nbsp;argument to its corresponding
parameter type</li>

  <li>Return context: when converting the expression in a return
statement to the method's return type</li>

  <li>Other context: used for a small number of additional
conversions</li>

</ul>

We now present Gel's implicit and explicit conversion rules.
&nbsp;(We
omit rules relating to conversions between value types, such
as&nbsp;between int and char; these rules are detailed in the Gel
reference manual and are similar to value conversion rules in C#.)<br>

<h4>Implicit conversions</h4>

Every type T is implicitly convertible to itself.
<p>If a&nbsp;type T is derived from a type U, then T is
implicitly convertible to U.</p>

<p>The null type is implicitly convertible to any reference type
or owning type.</p>

<p>T ^ is implicitly convertible to U ^ if T is implicitly
convertible to U.</p>

<p>In an argument conversion or local assignment context, T ^ is
implicitly convertible to U if T is implicitly convertible to U, and
either</p>

<ul>

  <li>the conversion is in an argument conversion context, or</li>

  <li>the conversion is in an assigment context, and the source
expression is classified as a variable.</li>

</ul>

Any value type is implicitly convertible to <code>object ^</code>.&nbsp;
In an argument conversion context, any value type is also implicitly
convertible to <code>object</code>.&nbsp; These
conversions are&nbsp;<dfn>boxing conversions</dfn>.&nbsp;
In a compiled Gel program, a boxing conversion allocates a boxed object
instance.
<p><code>string</code> is implicitly convertible to <code>object
^</code>&nbsp; and to <code>object</code> .</p>

<h4>Explicit conversions<br>

</h4>

f T is implicitly convertible to U, then T is explicitly convertible to
U.
<p>If a&nbsp;type T is derived from a type U, then U is
explicitly convertible to T.&nbsp; This conversion will fail if the
source value is not an instance of T.</p>

<p>T ^ is explicitly convertible to U ^ if T is explicitly
convertible to U.</p>

<p><code>object</code> and <code>object ^</code>
are explicitly convertible to any value type T; this is&nbsp;an <dfn>unboxing
conversion</dfn>.&nbsp; This conversion will fail if the
source value is not actually an instance of T.</p>

<p><code>object</code> and <code>object ^</code>
are explicitly convertible to
<code>string</code>.&nbsp; This conversion will fail if
the source value is not actually a string.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

Gel never allows a type conversion to a non-owning to an owning pointer
type. &nbsp;A conversion from an owning to a non-owning pointer is
allowed only in certain contexts as per the rules above; when such a
conversion occurs, at run time the source pointer retains ownership and
a new non-owning pointer is created. The conversion rules disallow
conversions which would inevitably lead to object destruction errors at
run time. &nbsp;As an example, consider the following method:<br>

<br>

Foo Fun() {<br>

&nbsp; return new Foo();<br>

}<br>

<br>

The type conversion from Foo ^ to Foo occurs in a return context, and
is hence disallowed. &nbsp;Gel could theoretically allow this type
conversion and generate code for the method. &nbsp;Then at method
exit
the newly allocated Foo object would be destroyed (since it is owned by
a temporary owning pointer, and ownership hasn't transferred
elsewhere). But the&nbsp;destroyed object's non-owning pointer
count
would be 1, representing the non-owning pointer&nbsp;returned from
the
method, and so the object destruction would yield a run-time error.
<h3>Safety</h3>

In this section we use an informal argument to show that every Gel
object
always has a single owner, and&nbsp;that hence Gel is type safe.<br>

<br>

At run time in Gel, every owning pointer is always one of the following:<br>

<ul>

  <li>a variable: either a local variable or method parameter
variable.</li>

  <li>a field: either an instance field, a static field, or an
array element</li>

  <li>a temporary value in an expression</li>

</ul>

When each object is created, it has a single owner: the temporary value
returned by the <code>new</code> operator.<br>

<br>

Suppose that a new owning pointer to an existing object o is created.
&nbsp;o already exists, so the new pointer must take ownership from
some existing pointer P. &nbsp;Then P must be owning, since the
language provides no type convesion from a non-owning to an owning
pointer.<br>

<br>

If P is a variable V, Gel
ensures
that V cannot be read again, as described in the Overview
section above. &nbsp;The runtime implementation may not bother to
overwrite V's value in memory, but V is unreadable and hence is not
considered an
owner;&nbsp;the new owner is the only owner of the
object.<br>

<br>

If P is a field, then the new pointer must be created using the <code>take</code>
operator;
any other expression reading a field value yields a non-owning pointer.
&nbsp;The <code>take</code>
operator
nulls out the field, and so the new owner is the only owner.<br>

<br>

Suppose that P is a temporary value. &nbsp;Every temporary in
expression evaluation is consumed at most
once, so in this case
the
new owner is the only owner; the old value cannot be read again.
&nbsp;As a simple example, in the statement "Foo ^f = new Foo()"
the
temporary value returned by <code>new Foo()</code> is
consumed once and only once, as it is assigned to f.
&nbsp;(Note that it is possible that an owning temporary will not
lose
ownership, as in the statement "Fun();" where the method Fun returns an
owning pointer. &nbsp;In this case Gel destroys the object as the
temporary value is destroyed.)<br>

<br>

We have shown, then, that whenever a new owning pointer to an object is
created the single-owner property is preserved. Since every object
begins with a single
owner, this means that in every running program every object always has
a single owner during its&nbsp;lifetime.<br>

<br>

Safety follows immediately from the single-owner property. &nbsp;We
assume that the underlying C# language is safe and that all safety
checks (such as array bounds checks) are preserved in the Gel
implementation. &nbsp;We will argue that every pointer which might
ever be read points to a live object (i.e. an object which has not yet
been destroyed); we call this the safety property. &nbsp;The safety
property is trivially true at the beginning of program execution, when
there are no pointers and no objects. &nbsp;We will show that this
property is true before any of the following events, then it is also
true afterward:<br>

<ul>

  <li>An object is created. &nbsp;In this case the new
operator returns a new owning pointer to the newly created object,
which is live.</li>

  <li>A pointer is created. &nbsp;If this is not a new object
creation, then the new pointer's value must be initialized from some
existing pointer P. &nbsp;Since the safety property was true
before,&nbsp;P points to a live object; therefore the new pointer
points to a live object as well.</li>

  <li>An object O is destroyed. &nbsp;In this case there must
be no non-owning pointers to O; otherwise a run-time error would
result. &nbsp;We have shown that there must be only a single owning
pointer to O, which must be destroyed at the same time since every
object destruction is caused by an owning pointer destruction.
&nbsp;So after O is destroyed there can be no outstanding pointers
to it.</li>

  <li>A pointer is destroyed. &nbsp;If this is a non-owning
pointer then this causes a reference count decrement, which occurs in a
live object since the safety property holds beforehand. &nbsp;If
this is a owning pointer then this causes an object destruction as
outlined in the preceding case.</li>

</ul>

We conclude that the safety property always holds. &nbsp;As a
consequence, no pointer access will ever touch deallocated memory and
so Gel is safe.
<h3>Erasure</h3>

Note that Gel adds only two syntactic elements to C#: the type
constructor ^ and the operator take.<br>

<br>

Suppose that we apply the following <dfn>erasure</dfn>
transformation to a Gel
program P:<br>

<ul>

  <li>We remove every instance of the ^ type constructor: we
replace T ^ with T everywhere.</li>

  <li>For each instance take E of the take operator, let T ^ be
the
compile-time type of E. &nbsp;Then we replace take E with the
function call Take(ref E), where Take is defined as follows:</li>

</ul>

<pre>T Take(ref T p) {<br> T v = p;<br> p = null;<br> return v;<br>}<br></pre>

(Informally, this is a function which works like the take operator but
acts on a non-owning type).<br>

<br>

Then the resulting program P' is a valid C# program. &nbsp;If P
terminates without error, then P' will also terminate without error and
will yield the same value as P.<br>

<br>

Note that the converse is not true: it is possible that P' may
terminate without error, but that P will yield a run-time error.
&nbsp;To see this, consider the following Gel function:<br>

<br>

int Fun() {<br>

&nbsp; Foo ^f = new Foo();<br>

&nbsp; Foo g = f;<br>

&nbsp; f = null;<br>

&nbsp; return 4;<br>

}<br>

<br>

This function will yield a run-time error in Gel, since at the moment f
is destroyed there is still a non-owning pointer g to the same object.
&nbsp;But if we apply the erasure transformation to this function,
then the resulting C# function will execute without error.<br>

<h2>PROGRAMMING IN GEL</h2>

We have described the Gel language and argued that it is safe.
&nbsp;We must now address two questions: how easy&nbsp;is it to
use Gel's type system for writing real programs, and how well will Gel
programs perform? &nbsp;We discuss usability in this section and
performance in the following section.<br>

<br>

We believe that many programmers writing in&nbsp;languages such as
C++ write code which frees objects based on&nbsp;ownership
relationships between objects. &nbsp;For example, most C++
programmers have written destructors which free objects pointed to by
the destroyed object. &nbsp;The popular scoped_ptr template class
from the Boost ++ library implements the ownership relationship; when a
scoped_ptr is destroyed the object it points to is freed automatically.
In some sense, then, Gel takes the existing informal notion of object
ownership and encodes it into the type system.<br>

<br>

But how practical is ownership as a universal memory management
paradigm? &nbsp;We've only written one large program in Gel, namely
the Gel compiler/interpreter itself. &nbsp;In writing the Gel
compiler we found that most objects had natural owners; ownership works
particularly well for trees of objects such as the abstract syntax tree
generated by parsing. &nbsp;Certain objects' lifetimes
were&nbsp;indefinite, and we generally chose to allocate such
objects from <dfn>pools</dfn>: arrays of objects held at top level in the program.
&nbsp;Such objects were owned by the pools themselves; we used
non-owning pointers to the objects throughout the program.&nbsp;(The Gel implementation, in fact, includes a primitive type
<code>pool</code> which can be used for allocations of this sort; we will not discuss pools further in this paper.)<br>
<br>
The Gel implementation includes both a compiler and an interpreter.
&nbsp;In implementing the interpreter, we chose to represent owning
pointers in the interpreted language using owning pointers in the
interpreter itself. &nbsp;This means that the interpreter has no code
to free objects in the interpreted program explicitly; instead, objects
in the interpreted program are freed automatically when no longer
needed. &nbsp;(This is similar to implementing an interpreter for a
garbage-collected language in a garbage-collected language, in which
case the interpreter itself need not concern itself with garbage
collection, which "flows through" the interpreter to the interpreted
program.)<br>
<br>
The interpreter contains numerous code paths which must manipulate
values in the interpreted language which might either be owned or
unowned pointers. &nbsp;To handle this situation, the interpreter code
has a class RValue with&nbsp;two subclasses: GValue, which holds a
value directly, and Reference, which holds a non-owning pointer to a
GValue. &nbsp;Code which manipulates values in the interpreted language
generally represents them using a variable of type RValue ^. &nbsp;If
this underlying value is owning, the variable holds the underlying
value directly; if it is not, the variable holds a Reference pointing
to the value. &nbsp;This was slightly awkward. &nbsp;We hope that this
particular &nbsp;coding difficulty was an artifact of implementing a
Gel interpreter in Gel itself, and that most programs in Gel will not
need to manipulate values whose ownership status is unknown at compile
time.
<h3>Circular data structures</h3>

<p>It's possible for a Gel program to create cycles of owning
pointers.&nbsp; The following program creates two <code>Bar</code>
objects which point to each other:</p>

<pre>class Bar {<br> Bar ^next_;<br><br> static void MakeACycle() {<br> Bar ^n = new Bar();<br> Bar ^o = new Bar();<br> Bar p = o;<br> n.next_ = o;<br> p.next_ = n;<br> }<br>}</pre>

<p>These objects will never be destroyed.&nbsp; Gel only
destroys structures containing no owning pointer cycles; this is a
weaker guarantee than that provided by a garbage collector, which can
destroy structures containing arbitrary pointer cycles.</p>

<p>But this hardly matters in practical programming.&nbsp;
It's hard to create an owning pointer cycle by mistake in Gel, because
the type system guarantees that a programmer can't create an owning
pointer cycle and return an owning pointer to it.&nbsp; For
example, if we modify the <code>MakeACycle</code> method
above to return a <code>Bar&nbsp;^</code> and add the
line <code>return n;</code> at the end of the method, we
receive a compile-time error: we can't return <code>n</code>
because ownership has already transferred away from it (in the
assignment to
<code>p.next_</code>).</p>

<p>All common data structures can be coded without using owning
pointer cycles.&nbsp; For inherently circular structures such as a
circular linked list, the Gel programmer must either (a) allocate all
list nodes using a separate owner object (such as&nbsp;an allocation
pool as described earlier in this section) and then create the circular
links using non-owning pointers, or (b) intentionally create a cycle of
owning pointers as in the <code>MakeACycle</code>
method above, then break the the cycle manually when deciding to
destroy the list. &nbsp;This is somewhat unnatural in Gel, but circular
structures form only a small fraction of data structures encountered in
typical programs.</p>
